# QLite-Simulator
Quantum Lite Simulator is a lightweight quantum circuit simulator that uses minimal resources to simulate quantum circuits with lightning fast speed.

To create and simulate your own circuits, use the <b>LiteSimulator.ipynb</b> file and follow the example circuits. The simulator uses the same conventions as IBM Qiskit, which makes it easy to implement circuits.


<b>QLite treats entanglement loosely, which can lead to incorrect results for circuits with heavy entanglement or superposition.</b>
