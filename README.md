# QLite-Simulator
Quantum Lite Simulator is a lightweight quantum circuit simulator that uses minimal resources to simulate quantum circuits with lightning fast speed.

To create and simulate your own circuits, use the @LiteSimulator.ipynb file and follow the example circuits. The simulator uses the same conventions as IBM Qiskit, which makes it easy to implement circuits.


QLite treats entanglement loosely, which can lead to incorrect results for circuits with heavy entanglement or superposition.
